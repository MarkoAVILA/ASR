All model checkpoint weights were used when initializing WhisperForConditionalGeneration.

All the weights of WhisperForConditionalGeneration were initialized from the model checkpoint at /nfs/RESEARCH/avila/Projects/SPEECH2TEXT/ASR/ASR/whisper-ft-base/checkpoint-24000.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use WhisperForConditionalGeneration for predictions without further training.

You have passed task=transcribe, but also have set `forced_decoder_ids` to [[1, None], [2, 50359]] which creates a conflict. `forced_decoder_ids` will be ignored in favor of task=transcribe.

The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
